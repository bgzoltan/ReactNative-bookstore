## First React Native code

## expo used the default Babel configuration so I had to create the babel.config.js and add the plugins section in order to use reaAnimated module correctly

## I had a version mismatch error when I added the Sweapable feature so I had to use the correct versions of the followings: "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.16.0", "react-native-reanimated": "^3.14.0", "react-native-worklets": "^0.6.1"

## I had several issues and this tool could help me: npx expo-doctor

## Start the frontend:  switch to 'frontend' folder then 'npm run start'
